# Changes

## 1.1.6
- Fix: **Empty selection fields:** the lists next to "Background" and "Grid" stayed empty as long as no preset had been chosen. They now always show a text: the name of the matching preset, otherwise "Custom colour" (also after switching between model and layout)
- New: **Grid colour:** the colour of the grid in the model area can be changed: in the bar next to "Background" (colour field and list with violet, grey, blue, green, red, orange, white, black and "Default") and under *Settings > Grid colour...* or *Reset grid colour (default)*. Dots, minor and major lines are mixed from the chosen colour and the background; the choice is remembered in the program (not in the drawing)
- Fix: **Hatch when selected:** for selected walls and cable ducts the hatch was covered by the selection colour (blue); the selection mark now outlines only the body, the hatch keeps the layer colour
- New: **Wall opening:** new tool in the "Building:" bar (Insert > Wall opening, command `OPENING`). Works like the window, just without glazing: the wall gets an open gap and only the reveal lines are drawn. Width, height and sill adjustable (double click); hatch and wall faces are left out in the gap
- New: **Hatch for cable ducts:** as with walls (none, diagonal, cross, solid fill; line spacing adjustable, default 20 mm). In the dialog before drawing and afterwards by double click; also applies to fittings (double click). 2D only, in 3D the duct stays a body
- New: **Cable duct alignment:** as with walls, the dialog sets whether the drawn line is the duct centre, the left or the right duct edge (2D and 3D)
- Fix: **Toolbars:** when the window was resized or a bar moved elsewhere, all bars jumped back to the original order; the chosen order is now kept
- Fix: **Toolbars:** a bar can now reliably be dragged between two others; the mouse position over the target bar decides (left half = before, right half = behind)
- New: **Cable ducts in 2D and 3D:** new tools *Cable duct* and *Join ducts* (Insert menu, commands `DUCT` / `DUCTJOIN`). Width (in 3D also height) selectable; flat in the model area in 2D, automatically a body on the face in the 3D view. Between two ducts *Join ducts* creates the matching fitting (coupler, elbow or tee) as a component of its own. Corners of duct chains meet flush (outer edge up to the outer corner). Own layer "CD" in red
- Change: **New toolbar "Building:":** Wall, Door, Window, Join walls and Room move from the tool bar into the new "Building:" bar (together with the cable duct tools); position and order adjustable under View > Toolbars
- New: **Documentation with its own font:** the dialog *Project > Create / update documentation...* has a new field **Font of the documents** below the title block template (default Arial; also "ISO" or any other font of the list). It applies to the cover sheet, table of contents and all lists and is saved with the project; the texts of the title block keep their own font
- New: **DXF export of the ISO font:** new setting *Settings > DXF export of the ISO font*: **As text** (DXF text with the text style "ISO", stays editable; font file `isocp.shx`) or **As lines** (every stroke a polyline, looks the same everywhere). Applies to the DXF export of the drawing and of the project
- Fix: **Grid in the model area:** the heavier major lines sometimes fell on every fifth line and sometimes were missing, depending on zoom and pan (rounding error when detecting the major line). The grid is now counted from the origin in whole steps: every major cell always consists of 5 x 5 small cells at any zoom; lines sit on whole pixels and have the same weight everywhere
- New: **Standard lettering:** new built-in single-stroke fonts "ISO" (upright) and "ISO kursiv" (15 degrees), modelled on ISO 3098 / DIN 6776 type B (capitals 10/10 h, lower case 7/10 h, stroke width 1/10 h). Selectable in the font list (toolbar, text dialog, properties, dimensions, rooms); nothing to install, screen and PDF look the same on every computer. Contains A-Z, a-z, 0-9, umlauts, sharp s, Ø ø Ω µ ° ± ² ³ € and common symbols. In the DXF export it stays a normal text

## 1.1.5
- Fix: **Exploding a block keeps attributes:** attributes stay attribute definitions (tag, prompt, size, position); the current value becomes the default. So an exploded block can be changed and made into a block again (before, the attributes became normal texts)
- Fix: **Grips on lines:** when dragging a line end point at its grip, Ortho (relative to the other end) and object snap including the snap marker, also **intersection snap with crossing lines** (a line can be shortened/extended exactly onto another line) now work (before, Ortho and the display of the snap point were missing)
- Fix: **Several monitors (Windows):** the menus of the top menu bar now open on the monitor the program window is on (before, they appeared on the main screen as soon as the window was on a second monitor). The same applies to the automatic dodging of the "Title block template" dialog
- Change: **Background presets in the colour dialog:** the choice of background presets (Default, White, Black, Dark grey, Light grey, Blue, Beige) is now also available in the dialog *Settings > Model background... / Layout background...* (field "Preset", with the free colour choice next to it). The "Background" field in the upper toolbar stays unchanged
- Change: **Model background... / Layout background...** moved from "View" to "Settings"
- Change: **"Insert" menu:** all dimensions (linear, radius, diameter, chain, angle) are now in the **Dimension** submenu
- Change: the menu item **Project > Evaluate single-pole representation too** is removed - the option stays in the "Create / update documentation..." dialog (as before)
- Change: **"Edit" menu more compact:** new submenus **Copy** (copy, copy with base point, precise copy) and **Manipulator** (on/off, move, centre) next to the existing **Align**; the entries are grouped logically: Undo/Redo > clipboard (Cut, Paste, Duplicate) > modify (Move, Rotate, Scale, Mirror, Stretch, Array) > Offset, Length, Trim, Break, Fillet, Chamfer, Align, Manipulator > Properties, Match, Find, Measure > Quick select, Select all > Delete

- Change: **"Settings" menu** instead of "Language": it now contains **Language** (Deutsch / English / Español), **Colour scheme** and **Manage fonts...** (before under "View", although they concern the user interface and not the drawing). "View" now only contains things that concern how the drawing is displayed
- Change: program version 1.1.5 (About window, installer)

## 1.1.4
- New: **Windows installer also in Spanish** (in addition to German and English; language choice when the installer starts)
- Fix: **Title block tags for the title named in English:** the three title parts are now called `TITLE1`, `TITLE2`, `TITLE3` in the documentation as well (the German names `TITEL1`..`3` keep working as aliases). The description of report pages now also reads `TITLE1`..`3` (before: only `TITEL1`..`3`)
- Fix: **Inserting a block creates missing layers:** if a block (or the layer it lands on) uses a layer the drawing does not have, it is created on insertion and shows up in the layer manager - colour/weight from the layer template, else from the block. Existing layers stay unchanged
- New: **Import layers and layer template:** the Layer dialog now has "Import from file..." (copy layers incl. colour/weight from another drawing or project into the current drawing; existing layers stay, one question if the colour differs), "Save as template" (all layers of the current drawing apply to new drawings from now on) and "Reset template". Existing and opened files are never changed. (Background: layer colours belong to the drawing, a block only carries the layer name)
- New: **Block variants (like EPLAN):** a block / device can contain several variants, e.g. the same socket in four orientations with suitably placed function texts. Create: select the drawing > *Blocks > Add variant to block...* > click the base point > choose the block file and enter the variant name (the file is extended directly). Choose: when inserting and via double-click / *Edit attributes* in the field **Variant**. Attribute values, device settings and links are kept when switching; freely moved text positions of the old variant are reset. Additional rotation stays possible (texts are never upside down). Blocks without variants and old files stay unchanged; devices already placed take over variants added later when their dialog is opened
- New: **Texts and attributes in blocks are never upside down:** if a block (e.g. an installation symbol in a building plan) is rotated so that a text would end up upside down (text angle between 90 and 270 degrees), the text is turned by 180 degrees and its anchor mirrored - it stays readable and on the same side of the symbol. Vertical texts (90 / 270 degrees) remain allowed. Applies to free texts and attributes in the block; device masks (IND/TYP/PER ...) have always stayed horizontal. No new setting needed
- Fix/New: **Stretch for walls:** walls can be stretched with "Stretch" (`STR`, crossing window) like polylines - corner points inside the window move along. Doors and windows whose centre lies inside the window are now taken along (before, they stayed behind and hung in empty space)
- New: **Spanish user interface** (menu Language > Español), translated by AnabasaSoft (pull request #6) and adapted by us to the current state: the language is remembered, missing Spanish texts appear in English (instead of German), a test checks that keys and placeholders are identical in all three languages. The F1 overview is translated into Spanish as well, dates appear in Spanish as DD/MM/YYYY
- Change: **all German/English messages that used to be hard-coded in the program** (status line, hints, prompts, viewport menus etc., about 300 texts) are now in the translation dictionary (keys `txt.NNNN`) and exist in German, English and Spanish; a test makes sure that no text is left in the code and that all placeholders match
- Fix: **"Join walls" when a wall already touches another one with one end** (e.g. an angle with one end already on the wall): the already attached end was "joined" (no visible change) and the free end stayed with a gap and a line in between. Now the still free end is attached
- Fix: **"Join walls" on existing angles / connected rooms:** if a wall continued in the extension of an angle (e.g. downwards at the corner of an L), it used to be merged back over the angle with its other end and the join failed or made no sense. Now all four end combinations are tried, joins that run back over the wall are rejected, and the wall is attached as a T junction onto the corner / centre line - without lines in between
- Fix: **ESC while drawing a wall or room** discards the wall / room in progress and keeps the tool active - the next wall can be drawn at once; only a second ESC (nothing in progress) returns to selection. Before, ESC created the started wall and ended the tool
- Change: program version 1.1.4 (About window, installer)

## 1.1.3
- New: **Project > "Evaluate single-pole representation too"** (tick, also in the "Create documentation" dialog): when set, single-pole symbols are evaluated like normal ones (lists, numbering, checks, net, PLC), so purely single-pole projects produce lists as well. Without the tick everything stays as before (never counted). The setting is saved per project.
- New: **Make 3D parts larger/smaller with "Stretch"** (same command as in 2D: Edit > Stretch / `ST`): select 3D objects, click the base point on the side to move (e.g. top edge of the cabinet), click the target point or type the distance (e.g. `200` - towards the mouse, `-200` reverses). Large parts (carcass, door, side panels) become longer/shorter, small parts on that side move along, the rest stays. Not stretchable: bodies on work planes, spheres, merged bodies, bodies with cut-outs.
- Fix: **Switching sheets with the 3D view open** failed with `TclError: window ".!canvas" isn't packed`; the 3D view is now closed cleanly / the display is anchored correctly.
- New: **3D objects can be copied to another sheet with Ctrl+C / Ctrl+X / Ctrl+V:** in the 3D view the copy hangs on the mouse after Ctrl+V (with object snap) and is put down with a click. Fix: pasting in the 2D view placed a 3D body wrongly (the reference point was 0/0)
- New: **3D - exact distance when moving:** while dragging an axis arrow just type the number (e.g. `300`, Backspace deletes, `-` = opposite direction) and confirm with Enter; also after clicking the arrow or via the input line
- New: **3D - object snap when moving and placing also with the edge midpoints of the moving body** (previously only its corners); the edge midpoints of existing bodies were already snapped
- Fix: **moved mask texts (IND, MAN, TYP, PER, number of poles) keep their position on "Create device"** (they used to jump back to the default position); moving a text later on the placed device overrides the preset
- New: **F1 opens an overview of all keyboard shortcuts, mouse actions and commands** (scrollable, with search field; also Help > Keyboard shortcuts and commands). The command list is generated from the program's command table, so it stays complete
- New: generator `tools/make_symbols_einpolig.py` for **single-pole symbols** (folder "12 Single-pole", attribute POLE for the pole count, attribute STRICH for the pole stroke "/" (empty = none), tick "Single-pole representation" preset); writes only into its own output folder
- New: **number of poles for your own single-pole devices** (field "Number of poles" in the device dialog, e.g. 3 or 3+N, shown exactly as typed above the identifier)
- New: **single-pole representation as second drawing:** tick "Single-pole representation" in the dialog of device mask, block, terminal and cable. Symbols marked this way are counted in no list (device, parts, terminal, cable, PLC list), not in the net, not in cross references, not in the project check and not in auto-numbering - drawing the same device single- and multi-pole produces no duplicates
- New: **walls, doors and windows for building floor plans** (Insert > Wall / Door in wall / Window in wall): adjustable wall thickness and position of the line, own layer "Wände", mitred corners, object snap on all wall edges; doors and windows are objects of their own (placed into the wall by click, movable and resizable by grips, double click = only their size, hinge side and opening direction), a door cuts the gap into the wall automatically
- New: **join walls** (click two walls > Insert > Join walls): both become one wall with a mitred corner, centre lines extended or trimmed to their intersection
- New: **hatch walls** directly in the wall dialog (double click) or via right click > Hatch wall: diagonal or cross, adjustable line spacing, door openings stay free
- New: **"Join walls" button** in the toolbar: click the first and second wall, they are merged at once into one wall with a mitred corner
- New: wall hatch also as **solid fill**; default line spacing 180 mm
- Fix: hatch ran through doors and windows; doors and windows on the wall line (position "left/right") were sometimes not recognised in the wall and cut no gap
- Change: **the separate "Change dimension text" window is gone:** double click on a dimension opens its properties again (with the field "Displayed text", the measured value and "Restore measured value", arrow size, end piece ...); the text is also in the properties window (Ctrl+1)
- Fix: **properties window for dimensions:** text height, font and arrow size can be set again (the fields were locked for dimensions)
- New: **end piece of dimensions selectable:** arrow or **diagonal tick** (properties window, properties dialog and toolbar); font of the dimension text adjustable
- New: **decimal places of dimensions** adjustable (0 to 6): in the properties window (Ctrl+1, also for several dimensions at once) and via right click on the dimension > Decimal places
- New: **door models:** single leaf, double door (two equal leaves), double door with one larger leaf (share adjustable, side switchable) and roller shutter (dashed in the wall opening). Choosing "Door" / "Window" first opens the properties window (model, size, hinge), the values apply to all following clicks; double click on a placed door changes it afterwards
- New: **Rooms** (Insert > Room, "Room" button, command `ROOM`): click the corner points of the room (any number, also L-shaped rooms; a click on the first point closes it), enter room number and room name - the area in m² is calculated automatically. The box stays invisible, only the text (number, name, area) is shown; clicking the text shows the box with corner grips to change the room size at will (the area is recalculated); the centre grip moves the text only, double click opens number/name. Font (also bold) and text height can be set in the room dialog. Own layer "Räume", output as text in PDF and DXF
- New: **Close wall:** clicking the same wall twice in the join tool (or right click > Close wall) joins start and end with a clean mitred corner
- Fix: **doors and windows cut their gap and hatch correctly only in the first segment of a wall** (in all further segments, e.g. rooms made of one wall, the hatch ran through the door)
- New: **walls form one common outline automatically:** where walls touch, cross or overlap, faces, end caps and hatch inside the other wall are no longer drawn (T junctions, crossings, overhangs)
- New: **T junction with "Join walls":** if the end of a wall is in front of or in the middle of another, it is extended or trimmed onto its centre line
- Fix: **Ortho** now also applies when dragging wall and polyline points by their grips (relative to the neighbouring point)
- Fix: **"Join walls"** got stuck after the first click (the click was pulled onto the object snap and hit the first wall again); now the actual click position counts, the second wall must be a different one, afterwards the tool returns to selection
- Fix: if several walls lie on top of each other, doors and windows now cut into all of them (before, the hatch of the other wall stayed)
- Change: the layer "Wände" has the colour #c29bff by default
- Change: program version 1.1.3 (About window, installer)
- New: **Hide cabinet doors per viewport** (right-click the viewport > 3D view in this viewport > Hide cabinet doors): door, handle and lock disappear in this viewport only; the same cabinet thus appears in one layout with and without door, without drawing it twice. Saved with the project, applies to object snap and PDF

## 1.1.2
- New: **Switch between viewports**: in the viewport view a double click into another viewport switches straight to it (as in AutoCAD), a double click outside leaves the viewport view; several views of the same 3D model in a layout can thus be set up one by one
- Change: **Linux package (.deb) with complete program information**: description "2D/3D CAD for electrical engineering", open source under the MIT license (AppStream metadata, copyright file), project page GitHub, category Electronics, installed size; the same metadata in the AppImage; the metadata names the package (`katiecad`) so the software centre can match name, icon and licence; icon declared in the AppStream metadata; the package refreshes the software catalogue itself on install/removal
- New: **terminals (and device masks) with a "show" check box per field** (IND, MAN, TYP, PER, NUM): hidden fields stay available for lists and evaluation but do not appear in the drawing; the others move up without a gap
- Fix: **export project as DXF** failed with "No page could be created" (since the fonts of 1.1.1 the DXF page received font arguments it did not know); the message now also names the actual reason
- New: **Windows installer with the KatieCAD banner**: welcome and finish page show mascot and logo, the other pages the mascot at the top right (several sizes for high screen resolutions), own welcome text, publisher and support links; images made from `installer/KatieCAD_Setup_Banner.png` by `tools/make_installer_images.py`
- New: **Linux AppImage**: the program as a single, directly runnable file (`KatieCAD-<version>-Linux-x86_64.AppImage`), no folder and no installation; built by the release workflow together with .deb and .tar.gz (`installer/build_appimage.sh`)
- Change: **minimum size of the main window** (1010 × 600 pixels, down to the screen size on small screens); the window can no longer be made so small that the program becomes unusable
- Change: **viewport view snaps while turning** (middle mouse button, view cube) onto Front/Back/Left/Right/Top/Bottom when within 4 degrees, so dimensions in the layout show true lengths
- Fix: **right-click in the layout over a viewport** only showed the viewport menu, even for dimensions/texts on it (no move/copy with base point); now the menu of the object under the pointer opens, the viewport menu additionally has move/copy
- Fix: a **cabinet without door and without mounting plate** was a closed box with "Hide hidden edges"; it is now open at the front (front taken from the plan, also rotated/mirrored)
- New: **change dimension text**: double-click a dimension or right-click > "Change dimension text..." (command `MASSTEXT`) opens its own dialog for any text (e.g. 150), `<>` = measured value, with a "Restore measured value" button
- New: **object snap in the layout on viewport content** (2D: all snap kinds, 3D: corners, edge midpoints, centres, without activating the viewport); **dimensions in the layout** inside a viewport show the **model value** instead of paper mm
- New: **move/copy from point to point in 3D**: click base point (e.g. a corner) and target point, both snap to corners, edge midpoints and centres, with dashed preview; right-click menu with "Move/Copy with base point"; commands V/M/CO and the Edit menu now work in space in the 3D window; new button in the 3D bar
- New: **view cube and "Hidden" button in the layout**: a selected/active 3D viewport shows the view cube at the top right (face click = standard view, arrows, free rotation) and a button to hide hidden edges; on screen only, not in print/PDF
- Change: **save questions** for unsaved changes (open, quit, open/create/close project) now name the project and sheet in a project and state that "No" discards the changes
- New: **message boxes in the design of the program** (colour scheme, Yes/No/Cancel, Y/N keys, Enter/Esc) instead of the system boxes
- Change: **File > New** always asks: with unsaved changes "Save changes?" (Yes/No/Cancel), otherwise a clear confirmation (default: No); in a project File > New closes the **whole project** (after asking "Save the changes in the project?"); sheets are managed in the side bar only
- New: **own menu bar now on Windows as well**: looks the same everywhere and follows the colour scheme (the Windows menu bar was always white); macOS keeps its native menu bar; set the environment variable `KATIECAD_NATIVE_MENU=1` to force the native bar
- Fix: the About window showed a thin line left of the mascot (1 pixel edge in `KatieCAD_Maskottchen.png`); removed
- Fix (Linux): **sub-menus of the menu bar** (View > Colour scheme, Place toolbars, also nested) could not be opened; they now open by mouse (hover/click) and keyboard (arrows, Enter, Esc); the menu bar follows the colour scheme
- New: in the **light colour scheme** the About window shows the lettering with a dark "Katie" (file `KatieCAD_Banner_dunkel.png`); violet and black keep the light lettering
- Change: **drawing background (model and layout) is a program setting** and no longer stored in the drawing/project file; foreign files open with your own background, old files stay readable
- New: **colour scheme** (View > Colour scheme): Violet (default), Black and Light for menus, bars, side bars and dialogs; applied at once and remembered
- New: **merge 3D bodies** (menu 3D, `3DVERSCHMELZEN`, right-click): several bodies become one body by boolean union, inner edges and overlaps disappear, holes are kept, saved with the project, can be merged again with further bodies
- New: **Manufacturer field `MAN`** in the device mask (order IND, MAN, TYP, PER, REF); *Manufacturer* column in the device list; the parts list uses MAN (otherwise the parts catalogue) and keeps the same type from different manufacturers apart. All symbols get MAN via `tools/symbole_man_ergaenzen.py`
- New: **Hide hidden edges** in the 3D view (button in the 3D bar): bodies look solid, edges behind them disappear, cabinets read unambiguously; a cabinet without a door is open at the front (mounting plate visible)
- New: **Hidden edges in the layout and PDF**: setting per viewport (right-click > 3D view), stored with the project and written to the PDF
- New: **terminals and cables** have the field `MAN` as well (terminal plan, cable plan, device list, parts list)
- Change: readable column titles in the lists: *ID* instead of IND, *Type designation* instead of TYP, *Rating* instead of PER (Terminal strip (ID)); the drawings keep the short tags
- Version jump to 1.1.2

## 1.1.1
- New: **Project > Export lists as Excel file...** - choose the lists, one .xlsx with one sheet per list (no extra library)
- New symbols: category "11 Installation" (socket 1-/2-pole, with protective contact, CEE 4-/5-pole, luminaire) and emergency stop (1- and 2-channel)
- New: **By layer** for colour and weight - check box and button in the colour dialog, "By layer" in the weight list of the toolbar, in the properties window and in the properties palette
- New: **Align at two points** (`ALIGN` / `AUSRICHTEN` / `AL`) like in AutoCAD: source/destination points, move, rotate and optional scale, with preview; the former edge commands stay `AUSLINKS`, `AUSRECHTS`, `AUSOBEN`, `AUSUNTEN`, `AUSMITTEH`, `AUSMITTEV`
- Object snap **Intersection** now also finds intersections of lines, rectangle and polyline edges with **circles and arcs** and of circles/arcs with each other (before: line x line only)
- Fix: the "Edit attributes" window (insert/change device) no longer grows taller than the screen with many pins (e.g. 16-channel PLC module): the list is **scrollable**, OK/Cancel stay visible
- New: **Own fonts** (View > Manage fonts...) - installed TrueType/OpenType fonts selectable, real character widths, embedded in the PDF
- New: 3D right-click menu **Copy** - copy a control cabinet or any 3D body; the copy hangs on the mouse with preview and object snap and is put down with a click
- Find and replace: new scope **Selection only** - searches and replaces only in the selected objects (preset when the window opens with a selection)
- About window: the title text "KatieCAD" is replaced by the **lettering banner** (file `KatieCAD_Banner.png`; without the file the text appears as before)
- Version jump to 1.1.1

## 1.1.0
- Find and replace across the whole project (all sheets); double-click a hit to jump to the object
- Match properties (layer, colour, line type, weight, text height) from one object to others
- Layer window: "Purge" deletes all unused layers (across all sheets in a project)
- Measure between two points (command `MEASURE` / `DI`): distance, dX, dY, angle
- Fillet (`FILLET` / `F`) and chamfer (`CHAMFER`) at the corner of two lines
- New elements ellipse and spline with their own drawing tools (Insert menu, toolbar, commands `ELLIPSE`, `SPLINE`), grips, rotate/scale/mirror, stretch, save/load, DXF export as polyline
- Angle dimension from 3 points or 2 lines (commands `ANGULAR`, `WINKELLINIEN`), grips, scale/mirror/rotate
- Fix: a rectangle was distorted when rotated by arbitrary angles (only two corners were rotated). It now becomes a polyline; in 90° steps it stays a rectangle
- Fillet and chamfer also by clicking rectangles and polylines (corner = that corner only, edge = all corners)
- Offset (`OFFSET` / `O`) for lines, circles, arcs, rectangles and polylines
- Quick select (`QS`) by object type, layer, colour and line type
- Chain dimension (`KETTE`)
- New reports: connection list, parts list (with parts catalogue for manufacturer, order number, description), cross reference list, potential overview, connector overview, label list, revision overview (all also as CSV)
- Project > Parts catalogue...; Project > Number devices automatically (`NUMMERIEREN`)
- Toolbar with icons instead of texts: drawing tools in purple, electrical tools in red; the name appears as a tooltip when the mouse rests on the icon; the active tool is highlighted (without Pillow the texts remain)
- Find and replace as an icon in the toolbar
- "Save block to file" and "Save device to file" merged into one entry "Save block/device to file..." (Blocks menu)
- New symbol category "10 PLC": digital/analogue input and output modules, CPU and single channels; each carries the invisible attribute `SPS` (CPU/DI/DO/AI/AO) and the channel address as pin name - basis for the later PLC list
- PLC: labels of the channel pins now sit to the left of the connection line; extra fields (invisible attributes) controller `STATION`, slot `PLATZ`, per channel symbol `VPn_SYM` and comment `VPn_KOM`
- New **PLC list** (I/O list: controller, module, slot, type, address, data type, symbol, comment, connection, location), also as CSV
- New electrical tool **Function text** (`FTEXT`): multi-line text on the layer "F-Text"; the device list and the terminal diagram show it at the far right in the column "Function" for all devices/terminals behind the insertion point
- "Load device from file..." (Electrical) replaced by "Load block/device from file..." in the Blocks menu (loads the file into the block library)
- Zoom +, Zoom -, Zoom extents and Reset as icons (magnifiers, circular arrows) in the toolbar; the label "Electrical:" is red
- Blocks menu: entry "Block list..." removed (same function as "Insert block/device"; Ctrl+B and `BL` stay)
- A cross reference marked "Handover / external" points nowhere and is never targeted: the same text (e.g. `L1`) can be used any number of times, no `L1.1`, `L2.1` ...
- Change length (`LAENGE`): click a line end, then click the new end or type `+5` / `-5` / `=50`; toolbar icon
- Align (left, right, top, bottom, centre horizontally/vertically) in the Edit menu
- Manipulator (`MANIP`): axis cross on the selection; moves only along the chosen axis (object snap counts only along the axis), distance can be typed, free move via the square
- 3D wireframe in the main view (toolbar group "3D:" after Electrical with icons, menu 3D, `3D`): orbit (middle button), pan (Ctrl+middle), zoom, view cube with direction arrows, perspective, grid on/off; right-click menu and double-click (properties, size, hide layer); pick a face as work plane and draw circle/rectangle/polyline on it, pull it up or cut it into the body as bore/pocket; pull 2D shapes up or down with the Z arrow; create box, cylinder, cone, pyramid, sphere directly; change size afterwards (`3DMASS`); 3D dimensions from any view; 3D view in layout viewports (also in the PDF); 3D manipulator (X/Y/Z); 3D blocks; plain wireframe (no hidden-line removal)
- 3D, round 3: when drawing with Line/Circle/Rectangle/Polyline the **face under the cursor is detected automatically** (highlighted in blue) and drawn on directly - sketches and dimensions no longer end up "in space"; new **Line** tool on the work plane (open sketch)
- 3D, round 5: **basic tools work in 3D** (Line, Polyline, Circle, Rectangle, Dimension act on the work plane / as 3D dimension automatically, duplicate icons removed); rounding also of **top/bottom edges** (dialog); manipulator with its own **orange handle** to move it (2D and 3D)
- 3D, round 6: **2D-only functions** (Arc, Ellipse, Spline, Trim, Break, electrical tools, Length, Fillet/Chamfer, Offset, Align) are **disabled (greyed out)** in the 3D view instead of throwing you back to 2D; **text in the 3D model** (Text tool, double-click to edit); **MEASURE/DI in 3D** measures the distance of two space points (incl. dX/dY/dZ, no new dimension needed); **sidebar button (☰)** with a fixed place at the bottom left of the status bar (no toolbar any more, stays visible while the sidebar is hidden); **drawing in 3D with the input line** (x,y / radius / width,height / length<angle), **OSNAP and ORTHO apply in 3D**; **control cabinet block** (3D > Control cabinet, `CABINET`) with 11 standard sizes, mounting plate on/off, optional door (with handle and lock, right/left selectable) and side panels, **object snap when placing and moving in 3D** (corners snap to existing objects), plinth 100/150/200 mm and free dimensions; **colour picker in the KatieCAD design with RAL Classic palette** and entry of the RAL number (e.g. 5015), hex or RGB value, plus a second "Colour field" tab (hue 0-360, saturation, value) and a third "ACI (AutoCAD)" tab (index 1-255, entry of the number; DXF export uses the most similar ACI colour); **3D text lies on the chosen face** (stroke font, height and angle in the dialog); properties dialog fits its content (no large empty area for 3D bodies); fix: right-click menu in the 3D view on Linux (only flashed up); fix: the "Rotate", "Round edges" and "Move manipulator" icons of the 3D bar turned into empty bars when the 3D view opened; info window now mentions the 3D functions; line properties dialog with **length** (moves the end point, point 1 stays); rectangle properties dialog with **width/height** and resizing from corner 1 or **on both sides about the centre**; Bars at top/bottom are laid out row by row without gaps (one frame per row)
- 3D, round 4: **selection window** like in 2D (cyan from the left = fully inside, green from the right = touching); **3D rotate** about X/Y/Z (`3DDREHEN`); **round vertical edges** (`3DABRUNDEN`); **manipulator can be moved freely** in 2D and 3D (`3DPIVOT`, Shift+click on the square in 2D) and acts as pivot; cut-outs not open to the top are **dashed** in 2D; the bore goes into the correct body when several faces share a plane
- 3D object snap with **visible markers** (endpoint, midpoint, centre, grid) when sketching and dimensioning
- The 3D grid now uses the status bar switch (grid on/off, F7) and can be shown **dotted**
- Fix: a fast second click was treated as a double click and swallowed in drawing modes / move / manipulator, or opened the properties dialog
- Fix: face detection also directly on edges/corners (front view: draw a line exactly on the body corner); toolbar order can be changed (View > Toolbars > Move forward/back, or drop a grip on another bar)
- Fix: the side bar could not be shown again after hiding it in the 3D view
- Toolbars **per department** (Tools, Electrical, 3D) can be docked separately at the top/bottom/right, wrapping into a new row in a narrow window
- 3D in a layout viewport: the 3D icon in a layout switches the chosen viewport to 3D (instead of replacing the layout area); it can be activated and rotated with the middle mouse button
- The symbol toolbar can be docked at the top, bottom or right (drag the grip or View > Toolbar), the choice is saved
- Text can be **bold** (text dialog, properties, properties palette "Arial fett"); also in the PDF (Helvetica-Bold)
- Terminal diagram: the same function text appears only at the first terminal of a strip
- Manipulator: while moving, the object snap no longer snaps to the moved objects themselves (this blocked vertical moves); the toolbar button stays pressed while the manipulator is active
- Toolbar: "Change length" now sits before "Find and replace"; "Mask" sits after "Function text"
- Version jump to 1.1.0

## 1.0.3
- About window: mascot picture on the left of the texts (file `KatieCAD_Maskottchen.png`)
- The About window can only be opened once (opening it again brings the existing one to the front)
- New shortcut Ctrl+B: opens the block list (block selection)
- Title block "Standard (built-in)" removed (identical to "Example A3"); only the templates from the title_blocks folder remain
- Linux: own menu bar without grab instead of the Tk menu bar - open menus close on focus change, click elsewhere and ESC (Windows/macOS unchanged; old menus with `KATIECAD_NATIVE_MENU=1`)
- Cross references: the same name over several sheets is resolved as a chain (outgoing → next sheet, incoming → previous sheet); `L1.1`/`L1.2` are no longer needed
- Coordinate grid: labels 0.1 mm smaller (PDF print looked bolder)
- Menu: "Trim" and "Break" moved from Insert to Edit
- Hatch like AutoCAD: with nothing selected, click straight into an enclosed area (crossing lines allowed), several areas in a row
- Stretch: if objects were preselected with a crossing window, the second window drag is skipped; only the selected objects are stretched
- Cross reference "outgoing west" / "incoming east": identifier next to the arrow tip/base, the target note behind it
- Automatic electrical layers: devices → E_DEVICES, wires/junctions/cross references → E_LINES, cables → E_CABLE, terminals → E_CLAMPS, single pins → E_PIN (instead of layer 0); layers are created on demand
- Coordinate grid: choose DIN A4 (6 x 4), DIN A3 (8 x 5, 395 x 252.59 mm) or custom values
- Cross reference: text heights of identifier and target note adjustable (new default 2.5 / 1.5 mm), texts movable by grip, position resettable
- Documentation: cover sheet, table of contents and lists in DIN A4 or DIN A3 (content scaled)
- Sheet list: select several sheets (Ctrl/Shift + click) to move and delete them together
- Fix: "Create documentation" now shows errors in a window and writes them to the log instead of silently doing nothing
- Cross reference: identifier and target note stand side by side on one line by default
- Terminals: terminal number (NUM) enlarged from 1.0 to 1.75 mm
- Texts freely movable (yellow grips) for terminals, masks, cables, pins and device blocks (per instance); right-click › Reset text positions
- Coordinate grid: labels stay inside their strip in print

## 1.0.2
- Installation location per sheet (sheet properties, F2): appears in the title block (`EINBAUORT` / `PLACE`) and separates the device, terminal and cable lists
- Menu: "Insert block/device" now sits above "Create block"
- Fix: dimension text was offset; it is now centred above the dimension line
- Radius/diameter dimensions named more clearly (DR / DD)
- Terminal diagram: column "Terminal (NUM)" now sits between "Connection top" and "Connection bottom"; new column "Bridge" with a graphic for terminals wired together (only the first terminal of a bridge shows the target)
- Terminal diagram: on potential rails (PE, N, ...) only the potential name is shown instead of every terminal
- Terminal diagram: every terminal strip starts on its own sheet
- Terminal diagram sheets are named "Klemmenplan <strip>" after the terminal strip (e.g. "Klemmenplan X1")
- Table of contents: "type" and "description" are now sheet properties (F2); default type stays "Circuit diagram", the customer is no longer used as description
- Block browser: the symbol library is listed only once ("Symbole" / "symbols"); a second, older "symbols" entry is hidden
- Fix project check: terminals without their own IND inherit the terminal strip like in the terminal diagram (no false "assigned more than once" errors); the same identifier at different installation locations is not a duplicate
- Info window: new subtitle with a focus on electrical engineering
- PDF import (File > Import PDF...): vector lines, circles, text and fills; PDF layers become KatieCAD layers (own reader based on pypdf, BSD licence; the MIT licence is unaffected)
- Image import (File > Import image...): images are stored inside the drawing, written to PDF output, and saved as a file next to the DXF on DXF export
- PDF export writes KatieCAD layers as PDF layers (toggle them in Acrobat, Bluebeam, etc.; re-importable)
- Hatch: selection box (lines/solid fill) with spacing and angle in one dialog instead of typing
- More compact Info window that fits its content
- Info window: Log button opens the log file in the editor (no tabs)

## 1.0.1
- Contact mirror for main devices (right of the symbol or below the relay), freely movable
- Project check: duplicate devices, cross references (with "external"), terminals, open connections
- Properties window (Ctrl+1) for mixed selections, also in the right-click menu
- Scale and mirror for objects, blocks and devices
- Export the whole project as one DXF file (4 sheets per row)
- Info window with change log and program log
- Fix: cables were lost when switching sheets
- Fix: right-click menu on Linux/Wayland, logo in the info window on Linux
- Fix: macOS info shows the correct version

## 1.0.0
- First release: 2D CAD, blocks, projects with sheets, schematics, cross references, terminals, cables,
  reports, title block automation, DXF/DWG import and export, installers for Windows, Linux and macOS
